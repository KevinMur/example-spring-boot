#   Example Spring Boot With Docker

Adapted from [the Spring Boot with Docker guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot-docker/) to use
[the Docker Maven Plugin from fabric8.io](https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin). This project demonstrates
how to Dockerize a Spring Boot application.

##  Getting Started

All Maven plugins and dependencies are available from [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/). Please have installed
* JDK 1.8 (tested with both Oracle and OpenJDK)
* Maven 3.3+ (also tested with 3.5.x)
* Docker 1.13 or better (17.05.0-ce-rc2 or better for multi-stage builds)

### Building

```
mvn clean install
```

There are three build profiles that will automatically enable the docker-maven-plugin. These are activated by one of
* `/var/run/docker.sock` existing on the filesystem
* a `$DOCKER_HOST` environment variable in the current shell
* specifying `${docker.host}` on the Maven CLI, e.g.

```
mvn clean install --define docker.host=tcp://localhost:2375
```

### Running

#### Maven Style

The fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin can be used to run the built container:

```
mvn docker:run --define example.port:8080
```

Leave off the `example.port` property definition to let the plugin runtime automatically determine an ephemeral port
to utilize.

#### Docker Style

Determine the container name. When built by Maven it is tagged with the `${project.version}`:

```
mvn --quiet exec:exec \
    --define 'exec.executable=echo' \
    --define 'exec.args=dweomer/${project.artifactId}:${project.version}'
```

Run via Docker CLI directly:

```
docker run -itd --name example-spring-boot --publish 8080:8080 dweomer/example-spring-boot:1.5-SNAPSHOT
```

### Test the Endpoint

```
# curl -v http://localhost:8080
* Rebuilt URL to: http://localhost:8080/
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.47.0
> Accept: */*
> 
< HTTP/1.1 200 
< Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
< Content-Length: 18
< Date: Wed, 03 May 2017 05:35:11 GMT
< 
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
Hello Docker World
```

### Docker Multi-Stage Build

The `Dockerfile` at the top of the repository is meant to represent a trivial build pipeline (as code). If you are
running Docker 17.05 or better with `--experimental=true` you may execute a single command to invoke the short pipeline.

```
docker build --pull --tag dweomer/example-spring-boot:1.5-SNAPSHOT .
```

Dockerfile-as-Build-Pipeline FTW.
